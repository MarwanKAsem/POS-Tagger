# POS-Tagging Machine Learning Algorithms

This notebook explores the implementation of machine learning algorithms for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. The dataset includes various features such as words, their POS tags, neighboring words, word length, frequency, and root forms.

# Features
The dataset contains the following columns:

Word: The token or word.

POS: The part-of-speech tag for the word.

Previous Word: The word preceding the current word.

Previous POS: The POS tag of the previous word.

Next Word: The word following the current word.

Next POS: The POS tag of the next word.

Word Length: The length of the word.

Frequency: The frequency of the word in the dataset.

Root: The root or lemma of the word.

# Notebook Content
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using pandas.

Data Exploration: Basic information and statistics about the dataset are displayed.

Visualization: A plot is created to visualize the relationship between words and their POS tags.

Machine Learning Algorithms: The notebook likely proceeds to implement and evaluate various machine learning models for POS tagging, though the specific algorithms are not detailed in the provided content.

# Usage
To run this notebook:

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (pandas, matplotlib, etc.).

Update the file path in the notebook to point to your dataset.

Execute the cells sequentially to explore the data and train the models.
